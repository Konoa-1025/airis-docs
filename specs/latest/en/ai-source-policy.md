# Policy on AI Source Verification and Watermark Detection

## Fundamental Principle

Airis is an exhibition platform where users can upload short videos created with AI tools such as Sora2.  
To confirm that a video was generated by AI, Airis analyzes watermarks and metadata from the uploaded files.

Watermarks are treated only as one indicator of AI generation.  
Decisions are made based on multiple factors, not solely on watermark presence.

## Detection Process

Upon upload, Airis automatically checks the following:

- File metadata (codec, resolution, creation date, etc.)  
- Watermark patterns from Sora2 and other AI tools (internal confidence score)  
- File hash and upload history to detect modification or tampering  

The detection score is stored internally and influences content recommendation and visibility.  
This score is not disclosed to users.

## Shadow Moderation

- If a watermark has been removed, falsified, or modified:  
  The content will be automatically hidden from public view without notifying the uploader.  

- If a watermark cannot be detected or has a low match score:  
  The content will be excluded from recommendations but not immediately deleted.

This approach maintains a safe environment without disrupting the user experience.

## Source Attribution

When uploading, users can voluntarily declare the AI tool used (e.g., Sora2, Runway, Pika).  
Airis cross-checks this declaration with file metadata.

- If consistent: Marked as "Verified Source"  
- If inconsistent: Internally flagged and demoted in recommendations  
- If intentionally falsified: Hidden or subject to account restriction

## Improving Detection Methods

Watermark detection for AI-generated videos is an evolving field.  
Airis treats its current system as a provisional implementation.

We welcome contributions and ideas for improving watermark or metadata detection.  
You can submit Pull Requests or open Issues to share new methods.  
Experimental and conceptual suggestions are also appreciated.

## Disclaimer

- Airis does not guarantee the accuracy of watermark detection results.  
  Publication decisions are based on multiple factors.  
- The platform is not responsible for any disadvantage caused by false positives,  
  missed detections, or watermark forgery.  
- If OpenAI or another AI provider retracts or modifies a video,  
  Airis may re-evaluate the content accordingly.

## Community Collaboration

Airis exists to share the progress of AI and celebrate creative expression.  
Watermark and source detection are not perfect,  
but we value feedback and contributions from the community.  
Your ideas help shape a fair and transparent AI culture.
